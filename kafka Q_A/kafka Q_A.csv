What is Kafka,"Kafka is an open-source subscriber-publisher model written in Scala. It is a popular data processing tool for data scientists because of its low latency and extensive throughputs. It enables scalability, low latency and data partitioning. "
What is the role of the offset?,"In partitions, messages are assigned a unique ID number called the offset. The role is to identify each message in the partition uniquely."
Can Kafka be used without ZooKeeper?,It is not possible to connect directly to the Kafka Server by bypassing ZooKeeper. Any client request cannot be serviced if ZooKeeper is down.
"In Kafka, why are replications critical?",Replications are critical as they ensure published messages can be consumed in the event of any program error or machine error and are not lost.
What is a partitioning key?,The partitioning key indicates the destination partition of the message within the producer. A hashing based partitioner determines the partition ID when the key is given.
What is the critical difference between Flume and Kafka?,Kafka ensures more durability and is scalable even though both are used for real-time processing.
When does QueueFullException occur in the producer?,QueueFullException occurs when the producer attempts to send messages at a pace not handleable by the broker.
What is a partition of a topic in Kafka Cluster?,Partition is a single piece of Kafka topic. More partitions allow excellent parallelism when reading from the topics. The number of partitions is configured based on per topic.
Explain Geo-replication in Kafka.,The Kafka MirrorMaker provides Geo-replication support for clusters. The messages are replicated across multiple cloud regions or datacenters. This can be used in passive/active scenarios for recovery and backup.
What do you mean by ISR in Kafka environment?,ISR is the abbreviation of In sync replicas. They are a set of message replicas that are synced to be leaders.
How can you get precisely one messaging during data production?,"To get precisely one messaging from data production, you have to follow two things avoiding duplicates during data production and avoiding duplicates during data consumption. For this, include a primary key in the message and de-duplicate on the consumer."
How do consumers consumes messages in Kafka?,The transfer of messages is done in Kafka by making use of send file API. The transfer of bytes occurs using this file through the kernel-space and the calls between back to the kernel and kernel user.
What is Zookeeper in Kafka?,One of the basic Kafka interview questions is about Zookeeper. It is a high performance and open source complete coordination service used for distributed applications adapted by Kafka. It lets Kafka manage sources properly.
What is a replica in the Kafka environment?,The replica is a list of essential nodes needed for logging for any particular partition. It can play the role of a follower or leader.
What does follower and leader in Kafka mean?,"Partitions are created in Kafka based on consumer groups and offset. One server in the partition serves as the leader, and one or more servers act as a follower. The leader assigns itself tasks that read and write partition requests. Followers follow the leader and replicate what is being told."
Name various components of Kafka.,The main components are:1.  Producer – produces messages and can communicate to a specific topic 2. Topic: a bunch of messages that come under the same 3.  Consumer: One who consumes the published data and subscribes to different topics 4. Brokers: act as a channel between consumers and producers.
Why is Kafka so popular?,Kafka acts as the central nervous system that makes streaming data available to applications. It builds real-time data pipelines responsible for data processing and transferring between different systems that need to use it.
What are consumers in Kafka?,"Kafka tags itself with a user group, and every communication on the topic is distributed to one use case. Kafka provides a single-customer abstraction that discovers both publish-subscribe consumer group and queuing."
What is a consumer group?,"When more than one consumer consumes a bunch of subscribed topics jointly, it forms a consumer group."
How is a Kafka Server started?,"To start a Kafka Server, the Zookeeper has to be powered up by using the following steps: > bin/zookeeper-server-start.sh config/zookeeper.properties  > bin/kafka-server-start.sh config/server.properties"
How does Kafka work?,"Kafka combines two messaging models, queues them, publishes, and subscribes to be made accessible to several consumer instances."
What are replications dangerous in Kafka? ,"This is because duplication assures that issued messages are absorbed in plan fault, appliance mistake or recurrent software promotions."
What is the role of Kafka Producer API play?,It covers two producers: kafka.producer.async.AsyncProducer and kafka.producer.SyncProducer. The API provides all producer performance through a single API to its clients.

The order will be same for both the Messages sent by a producer to a particular topic partition. That
Moreover, the consumer instance sees records in the order in which they are stored in the log.
Also, we can tolerate up to N-1 server failures, even without losing any records committed to the log."
Kafka Architecture,"Below we are discussing four core APIs in this Apache Kafka tutorial: 1. Kafka Producer API

This Kafka Producer API permits an application to publish a stream of records to one or more Kafka topics.

2. Kafka Consumer API

The Consumer API permits an application to take one or more topics and process the continous flow of records produced to them.

3. Kafka Streams API

The Streams API permits an application to behave as a stream processor, consuming an input stream from one or more topics and generating an output stream to one or more output topics, efficiently modifying the input streams to output streams.

4. Kafka Connector API

The Connector API permits creating and running reusable producers or consumers that enables connection between Kafka topics and existing applications or data systems."
Kafka Components,"Using the following components, Kafka achieves messaging:

1. Kafka Topic
A bunch of messages that belong to a particular category is known as a Topic. Data stores in topics. In addition, we can replicate and partition Topics. Here, replicate refers to copies and partition refers to the division. Also, visualize them as logs wherein, Kafka stores messages. However, this ability to replicate and partitioning topics is one of the factors that enable Kafka’s fault tolerance and scalability. 2. Kafka Producer
The producers publish the messages on one or more Kafka topics.

3. Kafka Consumer
Consumers take one or more topics and consume messages that are already published through extracting data from the brokers.

4. Kafka Broker
These are basically systems which maintain the published data. A single broker can have zero or more partitions per topic.

5. Kafka Zookeeper
With the help of zookeeper, Kafka provides the brokers with metadata regarding the processes running in the system and grants health checking and broker leadership election."

How many bytes of memory are required to store a single message in Kafka?,4 bytes (for the message offset) + 4 bytes (for the message length) + variable bytes (for the message value)
What is the minimum number of brokers required to form a Kafka cluster?,3
In what units does Kafka measure the throughput of a topic?,Messages per second (mps)
How does Kafka ensure data consistency across replicas?,"Kafka uses a distributed commit protocol called the ""Write Ahead Log"" (WAL) to ensure data consistency across replicas."
What happens when a Kafka producer sends a message to a full partition?,"When a producer sends a message to a full partition, it will block until there is enough space available in the partition to accept the message. This is known as ""backpressure""."
What is the name of the algorithm used by Kafka to assign partitions to brokers?," The algorithm used by Kafka to assign partitions to brokers is called the ""range assignment"" algorithm."
How often does Kafka perform automatic leader elections for partitions?,Kafka performs automatic leader elections for partitions every 5 minutes by default.
"What is the purpose of the ""replica.lag"" metric in Kafka?","The ""replica.lag"" metric measures the number of messages that are behind the leader replica in a Kafka topic. It helps in identifying lagging replicas and taking corrective action."
"What is the difference between ""fetch.min.bytes"" and ""fetch.max.wait"" configurations in Kafka?","""Fetch.min.bytes"" specifies the minimum amount of data that a consumer must receive before sending an acknowledgement, while ""fetch.max.wait"" specifies the maximum amount of time that a consumer waits for data to arrive before sending an acknowledgement."
